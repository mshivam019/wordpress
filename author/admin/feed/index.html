<p>If you don&#8217;t know what stoicism is don&#8217;t worry I didn&#8217;t used to have a clue either. I find it kind of humorous with the never-ending self-help books that exists that still tries to answer this question today when it was answered over 2,000 years ago by the ancient Greek word&nbsp;<strong>EUDAIMONIA.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/799311439966149952#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3aY6yUGcmR8/X_7fw2AN8kI/AAAAAAAABZ8/vBQpFhRrfvQGnoKAEAut5tk7KstOokTmQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I was writing about happiness and what&#8217;s the best practice to achieve it. The irony of my statement is that a lot of self-help book today are based on stoic practices but they have been rebranded to fit the modern world so even if you&#8217;re not familiar with stoicism there&#8217;s still a good chance that you practice it even without knowing it, for example things like journaling meditating practice of self-restraint are all in a way stoic exercises even cognitive behavioural therapy which some psychiatrists use to treat their patients were developed out of the ideas of stoicism the difference is that CBT is used to help patients for the time they need it while stoicism goes beyond and is more of a way of life so to explain what stoicism is can sometimes be tricky because it&#8217;s a wide subject with many great practices and many great philosophers so let&#8217;s begin with its origins.</p>



<p>Because to fully understand and engage with ideas we need to understand where they came from – Socrates</p>



<p>I love the origin of stoicism its foundation comes from its own name (<strong>Stoic</strong>) which in Latin is&nbsp;<strong>STOA</strong>&nbsp;I like Aristotle and Plato who had their famous grandeur in schools. Stoa meant simply a painted porch this is where the first teaching of stoicism were held stoicism derives directly from cynicism if you read my first post about Diogenes of Sinope, I find it mind-boggling that a man living inside a barrel affects our life still to this day and how we live so weeks recognize just like cynicism that virtue is the only good the main difference here is that instead of neglecting anything that isn&#8217;t according to nature stoics recognized that some things such as money for example are not necessarily good or bad in themselves or they can be used for good or bad too for that matter</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dtCl3kz2DN4/X_7gCk8SSwI/AAAAAAAABaE/iXkaPwsqe4kOXjZ7pajs44qrT6XGohhvgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/799311439966149952#"></a></p>



<p>Plato and Aristotle share this view as well and they don&#8217;t count as Stoics so let&#8217;s just get into the nuances there are many great Stoics Epictetus being one of the most recognized but there is no written record of his practice but he had a follower that wasn&#8217;t just anybody but the Roman Emperor of that time Marcus Aurelius ,Marcus frequently quotes Epictetus in his famous written word&nbsp;<strong>MEDITATIONS&nbsp;</strong>Epictetus describe what the fundamentals of Stoicism is which is actually very simple it goes like this there are things in life you can&#8217;t control and there are things that happen without our control or beyond our control according to Epictetus we should calmly accept when things out of our control happen but we as individuals can however control our own actions through self-discipline, you probably done this yourself at some point without the self-discipline part when realizing that something was out of your control suddenly and abruptly what has previously seemed terrible becomes unimportant.</p>



<p>The idea of not letting things out of your control change your behavior&nbsp;is a simple practice that anyone can immediately grasp but it&#8217;s much harder to act upon achieving virtue is not easy however the length the Stoics went with this idea is often heavily criticized&nbsp;misunderstood and dismissed as being called an epithetic here&#8217;s an example Xenophon when told about the death of his child responded simply and calmly with I knew my son was a mortal you can take the extreme of this quote in any way you want but the reality of the lesson is to simply not fight against nature and let it consume you focus on what you can&#8217;t control and let it be your virtue Marcus Aurelius who is known as one of the five good Roman emperors did not live an easy life he dealt with chronic pain and his ruling as Emperor would be fought against to practice self-control every morning Marcus would meditate he would meditate over all the bad horrible things and people that would oppose him that day here&#8217;s a quote from his meditations-</p>



<p>when you wake up in the morning tell yourself the people I deal with today will be meddling ungrateful arrogant dishonest jealous and surly they are like this because they can&#8217;t tell good from evil but I have seen the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own not of the same blood and birth but the same mind and possessing a share of the divine and so none of them can hurt me no one can implicate me in ugliness nor can I feel angry at my relative or hate him we were born to work together like teeth hands and eyes like the two rows of teeth upper and lower to obstruct each other is unnatural to feel anger at someone to turn your back on him these are unnatural.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/799311439966149952#"></a><br>Despite CBT deriving from stoicism as previous mention sources emit self doesn&#8217;t talk much about depression services some focus rather more on anger they look at anger as Marcus describes as ugly and irrational if you imagine an angry face it&#8217;s rarely a pretty one however it&#8217;s an emotion that is often today displayed in media when a character in a film for example acts in revenge he&#8217;s often seen carrying at the same bad lead that was originally done to him but we still recognize his action as somewhat Noble and satisfying we even enjoy seeing anger if it&#8217;s justified Marcus however received the word one day that his close friend in general Avidius Cassius had betrayed him Cassius had found out a rumor&nbsp;that Marcus was close to death and possibly even dead and so Cassius took this as an opportunity to declare himself as a new Caesar a betrayal of this magnitude would enrage and upset anyone if it happened to us but well Marcus did especially for the time being was astounding he did nothing he didn&#8217;t want to cause panic among his people if the word got out of the betrayal and confusing of ruling he instead acted rationally without anger and without hatred and made the announcement that he will march against Cassius not to kill him but to capture him when a friend betrays us we have every right to get angry but Marcus controlled this anger even mentioned that he hoped Cassius would not kill himself in shame before his arrival for Marcus coming would be a great testimony of his virtue Marcus managed to not just calm himself but his people and while doing so he did what needed to be done which was to secure the Empire and he succeeded Plato long before him said that philosophers should be Kings this act of Marcus was a true testimony to that statement a famous story quote once said it is not possible to live well today unless you treat it as your last death is always near in stoicism Marcus meditated heavily on this theme as well it might seem morbid but it helps remind oneself to live in the moment it helps you build virtue build character and prepare yourself to be ready to depart at any moment Marcus would meditate every evening to remind himself to be grateful for every day to me this is the most powerful part of Stoicism it&#8217;s called&nbsp;<strong>MEMENTO MORI</strong>&nbsp;remember death you might have heard it. Before I used to study a fair bit of Buddhism and what struck a chord in me was the idea of reincarnation if you live a virtuous life you will be rewarded in the next but if there&#8217;s no reincarnation then you still live the virtuous life Marcus had the same sentiment but for it way more eloquently here&#8217;s another quote from his meditations &#8211;</p>



<p>Live a good life if there are gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by if there are gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them if there are no gods then you will be gone but when I&#8217;ve lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of the loved ones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZrkLi_mshkg/X_7h-hVRB4I/AAAAAAAABaY/fgJNRcrPn1ogDMi3V423EqMHCZEN5N91gCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/799311439966149952#"></a></p>



<p>if you have a purpose you can live through any pain and suffering the purpose for the stoic is virtue and it turns any pain on its head that&#8217;s what makes so stoicism so powerful and timeless that is still practiced today.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. To not let it frighten you or remind you to live life with virtue.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. By practicing stoicism there&#8217;s no pain and suffering in this world that you can&#8217;t endure.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. Nothing can be taken from you for a stoic only values virtue.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. Any suffering and pain will be an opportunity for you to display and practice your virtue.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. By living life to the fullest you are also ready to let go at any moment. To not meet death with fear or anger, but rather welcoming because some things you just can&#8217;t control.</p>



<p><strong>Memento mori</strong>. Remember death.</p>

<p>Stoicism philosophy is on the rise. I have been practicing&nbsp;it for a couple of years now and would like to share 3 of the most effective and practical mental exercise/meditations that I have used.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/5102324031575703399#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bsrV1Tv7Fy4/X66ZZ9wYr5I/AAAAAAAABXU/FeZ9WuA-sRIUeFwFJnezjueoYE0-njlJQCLcBGAsYHQ/w521-h283/image.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<h3>Method One: A view from&nbsp;above</h3>



<p>&#8216;You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution&#8217;</p>



<p>–&nbsp;<strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></p>



<p>Marcus Aurelius advises us to perform an exercise called &#8216;view from above&#8217;. This exercise involves us envisioning ourselves from the third person. In this vision, we zoom out while keeping ourselves in the center. We continue zooming out and contemplating the scale of the universe. For instance, your first zoom might encompass a view of you from above the roof of your house. Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars.</p>



<p>With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial. For instance, if you were feeling down because a girl flaked on you or someone insulted you, try this exercise. It is far easier to overcome the emotional hurdles we experience when we put things into perspective.</p>



<h3>Method Two: Negative visualization</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MS6g2NCxgWo/X66YbNsWj6I/AAAAAAAABXI/C-AYCDn3gYMGZF8s0Y9O_ES4dgN1vHXQgCLcBGAsYHQ/w448-h252/image.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/5102324031575703399#"></a></p>



<p><em>&#8216;Remember that all we have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.&#8217;</em></p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Seneca</strong></p>



<p>Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practiced consistently. The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are:</p>



<p>• How it would feel to not have a roof over your head.</p>



<p>• How it would feel to lose social status.</p>



<p>• How it would feel to live in a third world country.</p>



<p>• How it would feel to have a physical disability.</p>



<p>• How it would feel to lose a loved one.</p>



<p>This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it’s meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen.&nbsp;You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.</p>



<p>This is a very practical way for you to practice gratitude, naturally, when you consider things being removed from your life, you start to gain a sense of gratitude. Now gratitude is important because of a thing called ‘hedonic adaptation’, basically, it’s a term that defines the tendency for humans to always go back to their default level of happiness.</p>



<p>If you won the lotto and became a millionaire, your base level of happiness will increase for a while. However, when you become accustomed to the lifestyle, despite all the new toys, you will return to your base level. Gratitude breaks this pattern, allowing you to enjoy each step on the ladder. You can be grateful when you own a box, and you can be grateful when you own a Lamborghini Aventador.</p>



<h3>Method Three: Voluntary Discomfort</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/5102324031575703399#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ARlj_a-CR4/X66bRDyH56I/AAAAAAAABXg/XRRqHbzFgFMLixgG68yFgVMaQdb6zjiwQCLcBGAsYHQ/w529-h276/image.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p><em>&#8216;But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself, and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him&#8217;</em></p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Epictetus</strong></p>



<p>The last exercise has been advised to us by Epictetus. It is called &#8216;voluntary discomfort&#8217;. In this exercise, we are going to deliberately put ourselves through uncomfortable situations. We will do this in order to train ourselves to not hold onto comfort with such high regard. We can perform voluntary discomfort in a number of ways. Some suggestions are:</p>



<p>• Cold Showers</p>



<p>• Exercising in the morning</p>



<p>• Walking in the cold without a jumper</p>



<p>• Fasting for a day</p>



<p>• Sleeping on the floor</p>



<p>All these things will change your relationship with comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier. Setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. When most people complain about being ‘uncomfortable’, you won’t be able to relate. You are literally training yourself to be like a Navy Seal. This method will harden you up for life.</p>



<p>Eventually the storm will hit the house at some stage during your life. You want to have to mental and physical fortitude to weather the storm.</p>



<p>So those are the three stoic exercises. Stoicism is a practical philosophy that has survived the test of time due to its universal applications. If you practice these stoic meditations, you will be well on your way to the good life.</p>

<p>Diogenes, also known as Diogenes the Cynic, was a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy. Diogenes is someone who taught me the true meaning of living life in the purest form possible.Stories of Diogenes:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/8299555879280162215#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cjeDaSj5ioI/X29IWxVS4yI/AAAAAAAABSo/0_QLdJg4sKcIsnpPSVIoeryf2MAurJRzgCLcBGAsYHQ/1601100525030822-0.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>1. During his entire life he lived inside a wine barrel. The only possession that he had was a wooden bowl which he used for everything. Eventually he got rid of that bowl too. When he saw a child drinking water from hollow his hands,&nbsp;Diogenes threw away his cup and remarked,&nbsp;&#8220;A child has beaten me in plainness of living.&#8221; He then exclaimed: &#8220;Fool that I am, to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time!&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/8299555879280162215#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KBBDcHdj7zk/X27a6407eoI/AAAAAAAABSM/QlfETEclPvoYP8uJlhRBUIox0q4vM7xVwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1601100519609718-1.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>                                       Diogenes and Plato</p>



<p>2. During one of the Plato&#8217;s lecture when he was discussing about the metaphysical ideal forms, In which he said all things have a pure essence , each thing has a form that define their true being. Diogenes who didn&#8217;t like metaphysical ideas challenged Plato and asked if the cup present also has some eternal perfect form somewhere to which Plato responded yes, infact the cup can take many different forms but their is perfect form of cupness that resides in our head. He then insulted Diogenes on his simple minded take of his complex ideas. Diogenes then responded what about the emptiness inside the cup, &#8220;Where is the &#8217;emptiness&#8217; which precedes this empty cup?&#8221;. Plato allowed himself a few moments to collect his thoughts, but Diogenes reached over and, tapping Plato&#8217;s head with his finger, said &#8220;I think you will find here is the &#8217;emptiness'&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/8299555879280162215#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SSA7T0UFnlM/X27a5iWO56I/AAAAAAAABSI/cQIRx8O5ltURYWdVfHm98DpGvRP_e4ugQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1601100515227834-2.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>                                 Diogenes and Alexander <br>3. One day Alexander the great went to meet Diogenes, who was relaxing on a field under the morning sun, Alexander asked Diogenes if there&#8217;s any favor he could do for him, he&#8217;d do it to which Diogenes replied yes by moving away since you are covering the sun. Shortly after Alexander declared if he wasn&#8217;t Alexander he&#8217;d want to be Diogenes to which Diogenes responded by saying &#8220;If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes&#8221;. This story shows the encounter of two extremes , Alexander who had everything and Diogenes who had nothing but only one of them was truly free. Alexander was humbled by Diogenes as he realized things we value actually carries little satisfaction on it&#8217;s own and all the things Alexander had and others wanted meant nothing to Diogenes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6519188314280087894/8299555879280162215#"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MdKSpQglqJ0/X27a4r3nrGI/AAAAAAAABSE/LgfydHvoK6oIWdWmfU6A6VpXrhmw-hynACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1601100501479912-3.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Diogenes work in history is known as &#8220;A Socrates gone mad&#8221;. They did not write their ideas they lived them instead. When he died he gave his body back to the earth as a way to return what he took.</p>
