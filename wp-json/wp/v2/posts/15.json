During one of the Plato&#8217;s lecture when he was discussing about the metaphysical ideal forms, In which he said all things have a pure essence , each thing has a form that define their true being. Diogenes who didn&#8217;t like metaphysical ideas challenged Plato and asked if the cup present also has some eternal perfect form somewhere to which Plato responded yes, infact the cup can take many different forms but their is perfect form of cupness that resides in our head. He then insulted Diogenes on his simple minded take of his complex ideas. Diogenes then responded what about the emptiness inside the cup, &#8220;Where is the &#8217;emptiness&#8217; which precedes this empty cup?&#8221;. Plato allowed himself a few moments to collect his thoughts, but Diogenes reached over and, tapping Plato&#8217;s head with his finger, said &#8220;I think you will find here is the &#8217;emptiness'&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/blog\/post\/edit\/6519188314280087894\/8299555879280162215#\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-SSA7T0UFnlM\/X27a5iWO56I\/AAAAAAAABSI\/cQIRx8O5ltURYWdVfHm98DpGvRP_e4ugQCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/1601100515227834-2.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Diogenes and Alexander\u00a0<br>3. One day Alexander the great went to meet Diogenes, who was relaxing on a field under the morning sun, Alexander asked Diogenes if there&#8217;s any favor he could do for him, he&#8217;d do it to which Diogenes replied yes by moving away since you are covering the sun. Shortly after Alexander declared if he wasn&#8217;t Alexander he&#8217;d want to be Diogenes to which Diogenes responded by saying &#8220;If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes&#8221;. This story shows the encounter of two extremes , Alexander who had everything and Diogenes who had nothing but only one of them was truly free. Alexander was humbled by Diogenes as he realized things we value actually carries little satisfaction on it&#8217;s own and all the things Alexander had and others wanted meant nothing to Diogenes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/blog\/post\/edit\/6519188314280087894\/8299555879280162215#\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-MdKSpQglqJ0\/X27a4r3nrGI\/AAAAAAAABSE\/LgfydHvoK6oIWdWmfU6A6VpXrhmw-hynACLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/1601100501479912-3.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Diogenes work in history is known as &#8220;A Socrates gone mad&#8221;.
